    // point the membershipPayment records were already created.) So when coming

    // on the spot, or a 'pay later' contribution being completed days later.

    // according to its way of handling completed membership payments, which
    // is to set the end date to the current membership period. No staff member
    // should be setting CPPT membership end date to that value.
    // So in that case, we know we should set it to the corret value, which
    // is the last day in the period for which this payment was due. And we can
    // know that based on the date of the contribution, because the payment
    // page will only accept payments for contributions that need payment
    // for the currently due period.
    //
    // $checkEndDate is FALSE when we're coming from the _postProcess hook for
    // the contribution. At that point we know we've already created the membershipPayment
    // records, but we can't tell if we have a credit card contribution on the spot,
    // or a 'pay later' contribution to be completed days later. However, if it was
    // a 'pay later', we won't even get this far, because we already returned (above)
    // if the contribution status is not 'completed'. So if we're here and $checkEndDate
    // is FALSE, then we know we've just completed a credit card payment immediately
